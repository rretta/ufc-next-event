A high-performance, technical landing page for upcoming UFC events, featuring real-time data integration and a custom industrial design language.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Check the live deployment at:** [https://ufc-next-event.vercel.app/](https://ufc-next-event.vercel.app/)

## 🧪 Proof of Concept

This project is a technical demonstration of **Antigravity** (Advanced Agentic Coding) using the **Interface Design Skill (MCP)**.

The objective was to move beyond generic component templates and build a "crafted" interface that mirrors the visceral and technical domain of the UFC (The Octagon, technical broadcast data, and industrial aesthetics).

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data**: Integrated with the ESPN MMA API to fetch live event schedules, fighter records, and headliners.
- **"The Fight Board" Signature**: An asymmetric design system developed specifically for this project (stored in `.interface-design/system.md`).
- **Dynamic Interaction**: "Impact Strike" hover states and high-performance marquee ticker tapes.
- **Layered Depth**: Custom oxide-steel borders and canvas surfaces instead of standard shadows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Data Source**: ESPN Scoreboard API
- **AI Tooling**: Antigravity + Interface Design MCP
